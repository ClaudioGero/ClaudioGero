## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Claudio de Lulimito.
Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at UFSC and a software developer with a strong passion for blockchain development. Over time, Iâ€™ve been sharpening my skills in Solidity, subgraphs, front-end technologies, and everything that connects to the Web3 ecosystem.

Some of the projects Iâ€™ve contributed to include the creation of tokens, as well as building websites and infrastructure for blockchain protocols. My goal is to continuously expand my knowledge and collaborate with companies in this space to bring more value to Web3 and crypto as a whole.
